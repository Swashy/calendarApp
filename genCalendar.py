    Get the first week. Calculate the previous month's days to display by
    subtracting the "number" of the first weekday (e.g. sun=0, mon=1)
    from last month's days.
    So if we had month days of 31, and the first weekday was "6", we would get
    25, which is incorrect so we add 1 to get 26.
    Thus, the first week would look like this:

    26, 27, 28, 29, 30 ,31, 1

    Returned from this function are lists of tuples, where [0] element is the
    day number, and [1] is whether that day is the current month(0), or the last
    month (1) so we can color them accordingly.
